Efficient Apricot Parrot is a quantitative trading algorithm designed for the E-mini NASDAQ-100 futures (NQ) using QuantConnect's Lean Engine. Developed by Daniel Chidi, this strategy leverages a combination of Break of Structure (BOS) detection, Fair Value Gap (FVG) analysis, HTF EMA bias filtering, and adaptive chop-rescue mechanisms to identify high-probability intraday trading setups. It features dynamic ATR-based position sizing, risk-managed entry/exit gates, and runtime optimizations for efficient backtesting and live deployment readiness.

The project includes:
1) Full algorithm code compatible with QuantConnect.
2) Strategy logic explanation and execution flow.
3) Sample backtest results (2022â€“2025) with analysis.
4) Modular code ready for further enhancements.
